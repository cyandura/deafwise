      <li>âœ… <b>HSA vs. FSA</b> - Learn the difference between Health Savings Account (HSA) and Flexible Spending Account (FSA). Which one fits you best? What should you know before you retire?</li>

      <li>âœ… <b>Pre-Funeral Plans</b> - I can guide you in making choices, such as where to be buried and how pre-paid plans work.</li>
      <li>âœ… <b>Consignment</b> - Understand the pros and cons. Know the risks before you sign an agreement for someone.</li>
      <li>âœ… <b>Free Credit Report</b> - Check your credit report once a year to make sure all accounts are really yours (and not someone using your SS#).</li>
